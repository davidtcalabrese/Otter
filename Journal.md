### Week 5
#### 2/14
* creating screen design with css, figma too difficult, going too slow
* working on home screen jsp
* Getting this error in GenericDao class
  incompatible types: org.hibernate.query.criteria.HibernateCriteriaBuilder cannot be converted to javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder

I think maybe Hibernate changed which class it is using (maybe used to use javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder and now users org.hibernate.query.criteria.HibernateCriteriaBuilder). (GenericDao.java line 44)

If I change the builder type from CriteriaBuilder to HibernateCriteriaBuilder then I'm going to have some issues with the createQuery method.
