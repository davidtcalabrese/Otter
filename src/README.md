Repository for Enterprise Java project.

### Problem statement
Need a non-addictive application to share one's thoughts with community. 

### Solution
Taciturn is the micro-blogging solution many don't know they need. 
The application will be designed so user can get caught up on the latest news in a minimal amount of time without being ensnared in an unhealthy cycle of receiving temporary relief from psychological pain
* no data monitoring 
* no addictive or "neutral" design 
* ethical design 
* not possible to doomscroll
* no hateful content allowed 
* very difficult to harass people

### User stories
* as a social media user, I do not want my data to be collected so that I do not have a creepy feeling of being watched every time I log in 
* as an app user, I do not want to be treated as a resource by the app creator
* I do not want to be fed controversial or misleading content
